        <h4>THE LAST STRAW BY BOSWORTH CROCKER </h4>
        <p>MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
            transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
            just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.</p>

            
            <p>[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
                basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                BAUER'S _door and looks in_.</p>

            
            <p>LANE. Say--where's the boss?
                MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
                [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._</p>
            
            <p>LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
                groceries for Sawyers.</p>

            <p>MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
                which hangs beside the door._] Here.</p>
                
            <p>LANE. What's the matter?</p>
                
            <p>MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?</p>

            <p>LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.</p>
