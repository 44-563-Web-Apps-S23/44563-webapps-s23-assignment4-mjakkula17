        <h4>THE LAST STRAW BY BOSWORTH CROCKER </h4>
        <p>
            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>No, Mr. Bauer's out yet.</p> <p>[_She listens through the
            transmitter._]</p><p> Thank you, Mrs. Mohler.</p> <p> [_Another pause._]</p> <p>I'll tell him
            just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.</p>

            <p>[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
                basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
                BAUER'S _door and looks in_.]</p>
            
            <h6>LANE.</h6> <p>Say--where's the boss?</p>

            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?</p>
                <p>[_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._</p>
            
            <h6>LANE.</h6><p>Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
                groceries for Sawyers.</p>

            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
                which hangs beside the door._]</p><p>Here.</p>
                
            <h6>LANE.</h6> <p>What's the matter?</p>
                
            <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Dully._]</p> <p> Huh?</p>

            <h6>LANE. </h6> <p>[_Significantly._]</p> <p>Oh, I know.</p>
